Zo: 19 years, female exchange student from Korea, sophomore, Aupair, recently got interested in music and decided to self-learn guitar, got an on-campus part-time job, working as a dining service worker,  to earn living expenses.
Nic: 48 years, an upcoming retired accountant, cranky and socially awkward, French American, trying to have I’a career shift to focus on his stock market, and planning to have gardening work around the house

Goal: contacted on craigslist, Zoe tried to get Nic’s listed guitar at an affordable price, but Zoe may struggle with English for small talk and bargain. Nic is pretty socially dead in most conversations with strangers, but he tried to get rid of his random gear, like guitar, for moving to another state.
Environment: offline meet at the door of Costco to trade on Wednesday afternoon, a cold and windy day, pretty low customer flow

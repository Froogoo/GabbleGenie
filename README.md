# Project Title: Conversation Flow Analysis and Visualization
Description:
This project aims to analyze and visualize conversation flows using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It includes modules for data preprocessing, conversation analysis, decision tree generation, and interactive visualization.
# Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleansing and formatting raw conversation data.
Conversation Analysis: Utilizes Gemini1.5 Pro to analyze conversation patterns and structures.
Decision Tree Generation: Constructs decision trees based on conversation analysis results.
(Future development required)
Interactive Visualization: Visualizes decision trees in an interactive and visually appealing manner.
Enhanced User Experience: Optimizes user interaction and experience through frontend development.

# Project Structure:
user_management.py: Handles data cleaning and formatting tasks.
conversation_manager.py: Generates decision trees based on conversation analysis.
user_flow.py: Implements interactive visualization of decision trees.
(require further fix)audio_preprocessing.py: Transcribe audio wav to scripts.
(future step)frontend_development.py: Develops frontend components for enhanced user experience.
(future step)user_interaction.py: Orchestrates the entire workflow and provides user interaction.
# Usage:
Prepare conversation data in a suitable format, prefer wav.
Use audio_preprocessing.py to analyze conversation patterns.
Generate decision trees in json with conversation_manager.py.
Visualize decision trees interactively using user_flow.py.
(future step)Enhance user experience with frontend_development.py.

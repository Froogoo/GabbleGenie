    Generate a detailed decision tree that forecasts conversation flow. Each node should be structured and numbered as follows:

    {
      "nodeNumber": int,
      "text": str,
      "user":str,
      "type": str,
      "awkwardnessLevel": int,

          "awkwardnessLevel": int,

          // additional children nodes can be nested here, with each having a unique node number
        }
      ]
    }

    The detailed strcture tree and labeled nodes should include:
    - consider carefully on users
    - consider major transition points for the whole conversation
    - don't use gemini, try to use predicted user
    - forcast all the conversation flow with numbered probability align with the goal
    - Small talk variations based on the conversation and users and environment I provided
    - Transition to main conversation goals, consider users bio and environment
    - Each node should specify the 'awkwardnessLevel' and 'goalAchievementLikelihood', represented as a number and a percentage respectively.
    - Node numbers should be sequential and indicate the path of the conversation flow.

    Please return a JSON-like structure for visualization of this conversation decision tree.
